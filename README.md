SQLAlchemey Challenge:

This repo contains an ipynb file as well as an app.py file related to the use of SQLAlchemy.

For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a climate analysis of the hawaii area. In the ipynb file, a database from sqlite is pulled with SQLAlchemy. 
From there, queries helped identify dates, precipitation, and temperature data across various points of time.
Charts were devloped to identify precipitation levels throughout the last year of a specified date, as well as min, max, and average temperatures of the area
Finally, an app was created (app.py) that allowed this data to be pulled through a local server.
The website lists available API routes and you are able to pull data from any date of the targeted date range that you wish
